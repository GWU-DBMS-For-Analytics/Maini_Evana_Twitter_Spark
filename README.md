Q4: How many statuses mention the phrase “SpaceX”?

## EMR Implementation

You can find the EMR implementation in the "EMR" directory. The directory includes the EMR Jupyter notebook used to read the raw data into Spark dataframes from S3, and answer the aforementioned 4 questions. Additionally, there is a bashscript used for bootstrapping the EMR instances.
